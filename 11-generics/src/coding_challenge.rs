/*
Let's model a real-time chat system where users can
share audio and video files.

Define a DigitalContent enum with two variants:
AudioFile and VideoFile. Derive a Debug implementation.

Define a ChatMessage struct with two fields: `content`
and `time`. The struct should define one generic type, T,
which will be the type of the `content` field.
The `time` field should always be a String.
Derive a Debug implementation.

Add an impl block for ChatMessage structs whose T type
is a DigitalContent enum. Define a `consume_entertainment`
method that prints out the value of the `content` field in
Debug format. For example, "Watching the AudioFile".

Add an impl block for ChatMessage structs with any type T.
Define a `retrieve_time` method that returns a String.
It should return a clone of the `time` field from
the struct.

In `main`, create a ChatMessage with `content` set to a
string slice.

Create another ChatMessage with `content` set to a String.

Create another ChatMessage with `content' set to a
DigitalContent variant.

Invoke the `consume_entertainment` method on the
ChatMessage storing a DigitalContent enum.

Invoke the `retrieve_time` method on all 3 ChatMessage
instances and print out each String's content.
